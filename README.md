# Visualising-TV-Data
The project was done with the help of Datacamp

The aim of this project was to manipulate and visualize television broadcast data in order to gain a better understanding of the different broadcast data sets; 
The Super Bowl: I generated insights into the game outcomes, viewership, halftime shows
The Office: I visualised the viewership and quality of the sitcom through its nine seasons
